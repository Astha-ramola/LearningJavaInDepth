	Abstract Class:
		-An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keywords
		
	-Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details
	 and showing the only functionality (function declaration) to the user.
	-Can not make object of abstract class directly, but through derived class
		
		 -example of abstract method ?
		  Abstract class may consists of abstract and non-abstract method.
		 -(0-100%) abstract methods can be there !
		 
	In case of Interface 100% abstract method should be there!
	
	Final class
	-The main purpose of using a class being declared as final is to prevent the class from being 
		-If a class is marked as final then no class can inherit any feature from the final class.
		-You can't extend a final class. If you try it gives you a compile time error.
